# Cacao_future_price forecast

The project is about building a model that can predict or forecast the future price of cocoa-based on sentiment news data on different topics. I have used weather damage and price forecast sentiment news additionally with previous close price values. This topic is a part of research on the price establishment at the futures market and cocoa processors in Germany.

    - post-processing (evaluating the model and some prediction)
  - conclusion
